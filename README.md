# Elden Ring Interactive Map

This interactive map is a tool that can be used to find items, search for them, or navigate to them with the built-in navigation system.
# How to find stuff (or hide it)
Simply look for your item, use the search bar to search for it, or hide items all together by unchecking them in the toolbar.

# Navigation System
Navigation is as simple as selecting a starting location (item or site of grace) and a destination (item or site of grace). After that, the shortest path is determined automatically.
