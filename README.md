# Elden Ring Interactive Map

This interactive map is a tool that can be used to find items, search for them, or navigate to them with the built-in navigation system.
# How to find stuff (or hide it)
Simply look for your item, search for it, or hide items all together by unchecking them in the toolbar.

# Navigation System
Navigation is as simple as selecting a starting location (item or site of grace) and a destination. After that, the shortest path is determined automatically.
